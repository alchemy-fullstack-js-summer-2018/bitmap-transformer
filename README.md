Lab 4.5 - Streaming Bitmap Transformer
===
This is a lab assignment that is built upon an earlier version (Lab 4) for creating a streaming bitmap transformer that can take in a BMP image (as a stream) and apply some sort of color transformation to each pixel of the image (i.e. make the image black and white, invert the colors of the image, etc.).
